<h1>Why Movies?</h1>
<p>Movies matter because they give us language for feelings we don’t yet know how to speak. When life tells us to “get busy living, or get busy dying,” films remind us that even ordinary days can feel cinematic if we pay attention. They teach us that hope can be as small as a flickering projector bulb or as big as shouting “Here’s looking at you, kid” into the dark. Movies roll when our own courage stalls, whispering “you’re gonna need a bigger boat” when fear looms, and then proving that we’re stronger than the monster in the water. In a world that sometimes feels stuck on pause, movies press play..</p>

<p>Films also connect us, stitching shared memories into a single, glowing reel. We quote them to signal belonging, like secret handshakes—saying “I’ll be back” to promise return, or “to infinity and beyond” when ambition outruns logic. Sitting together, laughing at the same punchline or holding our breath in the same silence, we learn that no one is truly watching alone. Movies turn strangers into co-stars, reminding us that “life moves pretty fast” but it’s better when experienced in surround sound. They’re proof that community can be built one scene at a time.</p>

<p>Most of all, movies help us survive ourselves. On hard days, they tell us “keep your friends close” and your dreams closer, nudging us to believe in reinvention. They remind us that even if things fall apart, “why so serious?” might be the right question, and wonder is still an option. Movies give us permission to feel everything—joy, grief, awe—then send us back into the world believing that “there’s no place like home,” even if we’re still figuring out where that is. In the end, movies don’t just entertain our lives; they help direct them. 🎬.</p>
